# JSON:API Explorer
The JSON:API Explorer is an interactive web application for exploring JSON:API
servers. [Try it!](https://explore.jsonapi.dev)

*Caveat*: this project and the example server behind it are using non-standard
features including:
  - JSON Schema
  - An unprofiled filter syntax
  - A "home document" at `/jsonapi`

Over time, we hope these features will be validated, polished and made part of
the official standard.

## Contributing

We're looking for help of all kinds!

Particularly:

- We want it to be beautiful
- We want it to be intuitive
- We want it to support alternative filtering strategies via profiles
- We want its use of JSON Schema to be standardized via a profile or the base spec

But most of all:

- We want you to love it

So, please, feel free to make open issues to discuss potential improvements and
then open PRs to make them.

## Set

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start` to activate the development server.
